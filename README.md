# Analysis of Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey

This shows the analysis of data of the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey(referenced from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). With this data, I found out that:

 * The most popular method of learning to code is Other online resources (e.g., videos, blogs, forum) with 70.91% of the developers. 
 * More than half of the respondents doesn't have a Master's Degree but they are a developer. This means that you need a Master's Degree in order to get a developer job.
 * The most common way to learn code online is Technical Documentation with 88.13% of the developers.
 * Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.) is the highest paying job with more than $100k average yearly.
 * The coding experience doesn't really affect the level of pay of the developers.


# What I learned
  * separate strings with delimiter
  * count the duplicates in a list and store them in a dictionary
  * plot a scatter plot using the matplotlib.pyplot module
  * read a csv file line by line
