# Analysis of Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey

This shows the analysis of data of the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey(referenced from https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). With this data, I found out that:

 * The most popular method of learning to code is in School (i.e. University, College, etc). 
 * More than half of the respondents doesn't have a Master's Degree but they are a developer. This means that you need a Master's Degree in order to get a developer job.
 * The most common way to learn code online is Written-based Online Courses.
 * System administrator has the highest paying job.
 * The coding experience doesn't really affect the level of pay of the developers.
